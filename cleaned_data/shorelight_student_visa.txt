Get ready to study abroad in America with our step-by-step guide to F-1 visa rules.â¨
Students wishing to study in the United States need to learn about the F-1 student visa application process. There are more than one million international students currently studying abroad in the USA, and with some preparation and guidance, you can join them. To help you get started, we have put together this step-by-step guide to US visas to help you understand what is a F-1 visa, F-1 visa rules, and F-1 visa requirements.

The F-1 student visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows international students to enter the US and study at institutions certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). It is the most popular type of student visa for students seeking to study at a US university or college, and you can only apply for your F-1 visa after an accredited US institution accepts your application.
As a F-1 student, the duration of your stay will vary based on the program in which you enroll. TheI-20 formprovided by the university you wish to attend will list the expiration date of your program. You will need to earn your degree before the listed expiration date, and this will give you an outline of how long you will be able to remain in the US.

Following your graduation, you may be eligible to apply forOptional Practical Training (OPT). This will permit you to work for up to 12 months in the US in a field related to your study. For STEM graduates, you can request two additional years of work in a related field. If you do not have any extensions or additional training, you will need to return to your home country within 60 days after your graduation. If you want to learn more, Shorelight can help you explore what you can do with yourF-1 visa after graduation.

1. Get Accepted and Get Your I-20
The F-1 student visa process starts when you get accepted to a SEVP-certified US university. SEVP certification is the US governmentâs way of proving that your university is accredited and has the proper resources to provide you with an education.Â
Once you are accepted, your university will provide your I-20 form. This form documents your study plans and provides supporting information about your stay.Â
The following information is recorded in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) when your I-20 is issued:
Your SEVIS ID number
Your program start and end dates
Your intended program of study
Your funding sources
Cost of attendance at your school of choice
Other personal information
Your university provides this information based off what you submit in your university application materials.Â
As soon as you receive your I-20, make sure all your information is accurate, and then sign the bottom of the first page. It can take a long time to fix an error on your I-20 and if something is wrong, you may not be granted access into the country. Retain your form I-20 when you travel to the US. You will need it to enter the US, to work, and for other activities (e.g., likegetting a US driverâs license).Â
