The F-1 and J-1 visas are the only student visas used at Stanford University.
Most students study with an F-1 visa. Not all students qualify for the J-1 visa. Stanford policy prohibits your using a J-1 visa if you are funded more than 50 percent by personal or family funds. You qualify for either an F-1 or J-1 visa when you receive a 50 percent research assistantship (RA), teaching assistantship (TA),  or fellowship from Stanford University.
To apply for an F-1 or J-1 visa stamp, you must first obtain an I-20 form (for F-1) or DS-2019 form (for J-1). These forms are issued by Bechtel International Center. You must include them in your application when you apply for your F-1 or J1 visa stamp at a U.S. consulate or embassy.
